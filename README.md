# projeto-blog-analia

This project is one project I started thinking when I return study about Front End things. After travell with my girlfriend around 10+ countries in Europe and Africa we have a lot of experiences we'd like to share with everyone.

My girlfriend is a journalist and copyrighter. She's working right now with a lot of things about marketing and how to get things more interessant for potential customers.

As a first project what I put here in Github, I tried to bring just concepts about HTML and CSS. Working with a static page until now.

The nexts steps by this project will be use a bit from js to get him more dinamismus. As soon as I can have free time to get this done It'll happens.


Until now, I'm coding the home page and after this I'll go ahead with the other pages.
